          "Mental illnesses are health conditions that disrupt a person's thoughts, emotions, relationships, and daily functioning. They are associated with distress and diminished capacity to engage in the ordinary activities of daily life. Mental illnesses fall along a continuum of severity: some are fairly mild and only interfere with some aspects of life, such as certain phobias. On the other end of the spectrum lie serious mental illnesses, which result in major functional impairment and interference with daily life. These include such disorders as major depression, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder, and may require that the person receives care in a hospital. It is important to know that mental illnesses are medical conditions that have nothing to do with a person's character, intelligence, or willpower. Just as diabetes is a disorder of the pancreas, mental illness is a medical condition due to the brain's biology. Similarly to how one would treat diabetes with medication and insulin, mental illness is treatable with a combination of medication and social support. These treatments are highly effective, with 70-90 percent of individuals receiving treatment experiencing a reduction in symptoms and an improved quality of life. With the proper treatment, it is very possible for a person with mental illness to be independent and successful."

      "Stress and anxiety are often used interchangeably, but there are distinctions between the two. Stress typically arises from external pressures or demands that exceed our ability to cope, such as work deadlines or financial worries. When stressed, we usually know the cause, and symptoms often subside once the stressor is removed. Anxiety, on the other hand, involves persistent worry or fear about potential threats or future events, even if the source of concern is unclear or irrational. Anxiety may manifest with physical symptoms similar to stress, but it can be more pervasive and enduring, impacting daily functioning and well-being. While both are common human experiences, prolonged or severe stress and anxiety may require professional support and intervention."

      "Sadness is a normal emotional response to situations like loss, disappointment, or difficulties, and it tends to be temporary, resolving as circumstances change. Feeling sad is a common part of the human experience. Depression, however, is a mental illness characterized by persistent and pervasive feelings of low mood, worthlessness, hopelessness, and a loss of interest or pleasure in activities once enjoyed. Unlike sadness, depression often persists for an extended period, impacting various aspects of life, including relationships, work, and daily functioning. Symptoms of depression can also include changes in sleep and appetite, fatigue, difficulty concentrating, and thoughts of death or suicide. While sadness is a natural emotion, depression is a serious medical condition that requires proper diagnosis and treatment by a healthcare professional."
